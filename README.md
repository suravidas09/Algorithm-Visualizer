# Algorithm-Visualizer
This project is designed to show a variety of incredibly useful sorting algorithms. It now supports visualisation of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. We can add as many algorithms as we like in the future. The user interface was created using the Python Tkinter toolkit and kept as minimal as possible to improve code readability. During the implementation of each procedure, standard colours have been used to indicate the status of each element in the array. It also has other features like a combobox for selecting the reuired algorithm, selecting the data size (array of random numbers) and the visualisation speed.
